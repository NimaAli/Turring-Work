2. Write a function that tests if an integer is a multiple of 7. Write a program to test your function. Do not use user input.
function mul7 (number : int) : boolean
    if number mod 7 = 0 then 
        result true
    else
        result false
    end if
end mul7 

var number : int
randint (number, 1, 10000)
if mul7(number) then 
    put "The number which is ", number," is a multiple of 7."
else
    put "The number which is ", number," is not a multiple of 7."
end if
