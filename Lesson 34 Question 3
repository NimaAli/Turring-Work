3. A word is a palindrome if it is the same in reverse.  You should write a function that checks whether a specific word is a palindrome.
Write a program to test your function.  Hint: you could use two functions!  The one you write which checks whether it is a palindrome
and the one you wrote before to reverse a string.
function pal_check (word : string) : boolean
    var new_word : string := ""
    for decreasing i : length(word) .. 1
        new_word += word(i)
    end for
% if I were to use two functions this would be the second one
    if new_word = word then 
        result true
    else 
        result false
    end if
end pal_check

% main program

var user_word : string
put "Enter a word to check if it's a palindrome : "..
get user_word
if pal_check(user_word) then
    put "Your word is a palindrome."
else
    put "Your word isn't a palindrome."
end if
